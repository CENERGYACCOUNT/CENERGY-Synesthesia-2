		{ "Tooltrust", [[By default, you don't have tooltrust, you have phystrust and you have proptrust. Phys- and proptrust give you a physgun and the ability to spawn props respectively. Tooltrust gives you a toolgun.
		
		Basic tooltrust gives you some common simple tools, a slightly increased prop limit, and slightly increased prop spawn permissions. To get this, ask an admin.
		
		Advanced tooltrust gives you most tools, an increased prop limit, and increased prop spawn permissions. Advanced tooltrust users' props are solid, whereas basic and non tooltrusted props are no-collided. To get this, check the forums.
		
		Admins can take away phys and proptrust if you abuse the privillege.]] },
		{ "Making Money", [[There are a few ways to earn credits in CombineControl.
		
		1) Rations contain a stipend of credits.
		
		2) Form a business and sell items. To do this, open the player menu and go to the Business tab. You need to buy a business license first. Check the Businesses help menu topic for more.
		
		3) Sell services. Offer to clean another citizen's apartment, or do advertising for someone's business. Check if a CP wants you to wash something. Repair TVs or stoves for people (assuming you're perceptive enough). You never know what kind of work you'll find!
		
		4) Go illegal. Although getting arrested is a possible consequence, making a drug lab or taking hit requests is lucrative if you know how.
		
		5) Loans are a temporary way of getting credits. Open the Loans tab in the player menu.
		
		6) Put up propaganda posters for the Combine. Although you're sacrificing some of your dignity, you'll earn a small amount of credits for each poster.]] },
		{ "Businesses", [[Businesses in CombineControl are pretty loosely organized. Any character can make a business.
		
		First, you need business licenses. ICly, these are sold by the CCA and allow you to buy inventory in bulk. They're not cheap, but once you have one you can start buying items. Loans are good for this purpose.
		
		With a business license, you can buy inventory. Items come in 1s or packs of 5, so you need some startup capital. Be sure you can sell them all, or you'll end up with a bunch of junk sitting around in your inventory. Also, be warned that buying inventory doesn't check your inventory size, so if you buy literally tons of items, be prepared to not be able to run until you can sell everything.]] },
		{ "Stats", [[Stats are more in-depth in CombineControl than in other gamemodes.
		
		Speed
		- Determines how fast you run.
		- Increase this by running.
		Strength
		- Determines how far you can throw things, how hard you can punch, how much you can carry, etc.
